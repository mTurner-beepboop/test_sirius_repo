  description: IoT devices are becoming more common and prevalent in private households.
    Since guests can be present in IoT-equipped households, IoT devices can pose considerable
    privacy risks to them. In this paper, we present an in-depth evaluation of privacy
    protection for guests considering the perspectives of hosts and guests. First,
    we interviewed 21 IoT device owners about four classes of mechanisms obtained
    from the literature Second, we conducted an online survey that investigates the
    perspective of guests in IoT-equipped households (N= 264). From our results, we
    learn that protection mechanisms should not introduce privacy threats and require
    low resources. Further, hosts should keep control over their devices and the aesthetics
    of their living spaces. Guests, however, value feedback about the status of privacy
    protection which can interfere with aesthetics. Privacy protection should rather
    foster collaboration and not impact the visit of the guest too severely. We use
    our results to identify a design space for guest privacy protection in IoT-equipped
    households.

    \ not always indicate an attack. To overcome this limitation, in a novel data\

    \ are vulnerable independent of the observation location. We then present PrivacyScout\u2013\
    a novel method that predicts the shoulder-surfing risk based on visual features\

  description: The transposition of the EU Directive on Network and Information Security
    (NIS) by EU Member States involved assigning a set of responsibilities to operators,
    regulators and policy makers within a national cybersecurity strategy, in order
    to improve cybersecurity levels across critical infrastructures. This research
    investigates the perspectives and experiences of organisations affected by the
    NIS Directive focussing on three different sectors (Energy, Water & Aviation).
    The authors evaluate the response of different actors to NIS interventions and
    their challenges in meeting their assigned responsibilities, in particular their
    ability to oversee supply chain cybersecurity. It proposes further support for
    partnerships and cooperation across organisations to increase the effectiveness
    of NIS implementation. Based on results from semi-structured interviews and observations
    of industry working groups, an approach to supply chain oversight to achieve a
    balance between control and cooperation is recommended, to improve cybersecurity
    within industry sectors and across critical national infrastructures. Although
    our initial focus has been on working mainly with UK stakeholders, we argue that
    our recommendations have a more general application beyond those countries directly
    affected by the Directive.

    With this work we advance the well-established smooth pursuits technique, which
    allows gaze interaction without calibration. The approach is valuable for researchers
    and practitioners, since it enables novel user interfaces and applications to
    be created that employ a large number of targets, for example, a pursuits-based
    keyboard or a smart home where many different objects can be controlled using
    gaze. We present findings from two studies. In particular, we compare our novel
    detection algorithm based on linear regression with the correlation method. We
    quantify its accuracy for around 20 targets on a single circle and up to 160 targets
    on multiple circles. Finally, we implemented a pursuits-based keyboard app with
    108 targets as proof-of-concept.

  description: Nowadays, most mobile devices support biometric authentication schemes
    like fingerprint or face unlock. However, these probabilistic mechanisms can only
    be activated in combination with a second alternative factor, usually knowledge-based
    authentication. In this paper, we show that this aspect can be exploited in a
    bypass attack. In this bypass attack, the attacker forces the user to "bypass"
    the biometric authentication by, for example, resetting the phone. This forces
    the user to enter an easy-to-observe passcode instead. We present the threat model
    and provide preliminary results of an online survey. Based on our results, we
    discuss potential countermeasures. We conclude that better feedback design and
    security-optimized fallback mechanisms can help further improve the overall security
    of mobile unlock mechanisms while preserving usability.

    which improves over prior work on smooth pursuit text entry by 1) eliminating
    the need of calibration using motion correlation, 2) increasing input rate from
    3.34 to 3.41 words per minute, 3) featuring text suggestions that were trained
    on 10,000 lexicon sentences recommended in the literature. We report on a user
    study (N= 26) which shows that users are able to eye type at 3.41 words per minutes
    without calibration and without user training. Qualitative feedback also indicates
    that users positively perceive the system. Our work is of particular benefit for
    disabled users and for situations when voice and tactile input are not feasible
    (eg, in noisy environments or when the hands are occupied).

  description: Most of the already existing authentication schemes are subject to
    multiple types of side-channel attacks such as shoulder surfing, smudge attacks,
    and thermal attacks. Meanwhile, motion sensors and eye trackers are becoming more
    accurate. We propose a novel authentication technique that leverages a combination
    of mid-air gestures and gaze input for shoulder surfing resilient authentication.
    The aim is to complicate shoulder surfing attacks by dividing the attacker's attention
    onto 1) the user's eyes, 2) hand-gestures, and 3) the screen. We report on the
    concept and implementation of the approach using both random and fixed layouts.

  description: Users often need to authenticate at situated displays in order to,
    for example, make purchases, access sensitive information, or confirm an identity.
    However, the exposure of interactions in public spaces introduces a large attack
    surface (eg, observation, smudge or thermal attacks). A plethora of authentication
    models and input modalities that aim at disguising users' input has been presented
    in the past. However, a comprehensive analysis on the requirements for secure

    13 design considerations suitable to inform practitioners and researchers during
    the development process of authentication systems for situated displays in public
    spaces. It draws on a comprehensive analysis of prior literature and subsequent
    discussion with five experts in the fields of pervasive displays, human-computer-interaction

  description: In this work, we show how the use of flickering in Cinematic Virtual
    Reality (CVR) content can not only guide the user's attention, but also significantly
    improve recall of details. The findings are particularly useful for practitioners
    who generate educational and corporate training content, as well as for directors
    of CVR videos who want to draw the user's attention to certain details in movies
    or virtual tours. We report on a between-subjects user study, in which we experimented
    with flickering methods to increase user's recall of certain details in CVR videos.
    Participants had to report details of objects on which the method was applied.
    In our experiments, the intensive flicker improved the recall of details significantly.
    We discuss how the studied methods can improve recall of details in different
    use cases.

  description: "The last decade witnessed an increasing adoption of public interactive\
    \ displays. Displays can now be seen in many public areas, such as shopping malls,\
    \ and train stations. There is also a growing trend towards using large public\
    \ displays especially in airports, urban areas, universities and libraries. Meanwhile,\
    \ advances in eye tracking and visual computing promise straightforward integration\
    \ of eye tracking on these displays for both: 1) monitoring the user's visual\
    \ behavior to evaluate different aspects of the display, such as measuring the\
    \ visual attention of passersby, and for 2) interaction purposes, such as allowing\
    \ users to provide input, retrieve content, or transfer data using their eye movements.\
    \ Gaze is particularly useful for pervasive public displays. In addition to being\
    \ natural and intuitive, eye gaze can be detected from a distance, bringing interactivity\
    \ to displays that are physically unreachable. Gaze reflects the user's intention\
    \ and visual interests, and its subtle nature makes it well-suited for public\
    \ interactions where social embarrassment and privacy concerns might hinder the\
    \ experience. On the downside, eye tracking technologies have traditionally been\
    \ developed for desktop settings, where a user interacts from a stationary position\
    \ and for a relatively long period of time. Interaction with public displays is\
    \ fundamentally different and hence poses unique challenges when employing eye\
    \ tracking. First, users of public displays are dynamic; users could approach\
    \ the display from different directions, and interact from different positions\
    \ or even while moving. This means that gaze-enabled displays should not expect\

    (N= 117) in which we studied technology-related privacy concerns of users from
    different countries, including developing countries such as Egypt, and Saudi Arabia,
    and developed countries such as Germany. By comparing results from those countries,

    that are specific to privacy of users from under-investigated countries. We discuss

  description: While the eyes are very important in human communication, once a user
    puts on a head mounted display (HMD), the face is obscured from the outside world's
    perspective. This leads to communication problems when bystanders approach or
    collaborate with an HMD user. We introduce transparentHMD, which employs a head-coupled
    perspective technique to produce an illusion of a transparent HMD to bystanders.
    We created a self contained system, based on a mobile device mounted on the HMD
    with the screen facing bystanders. By tracking the relative position of the bystander
    using the smartphone's camera, we render an adapting perspective view in realtime
    that creates the illusion of a transparent HMD. By revealing the user's face to
    bystanders, our easy to implement system allows for opportunities to investigate
    a plethora of research questions particularly related to collaborative VR systems.
