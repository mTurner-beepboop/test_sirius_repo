  description: "Shoulder surfing is a prevailing threat when accessing smartphone\
    \ information at different locations. Prior work has proposed numerous mechanisms\
    \ to combat the threat, however, when and what mechanism to use while maintaining\
    \ appreciable user experience and usability remains a challenge. Further, the\
    \ subjective interpretation of sensitive content adds to the challenge of protecting\
    \ users\u2019 privacy and security. In this poster, we present preliminary findings\
    \ on what users perceive as sensitive information in the context of shoulder surfing\
    \ from an online survey with N= 40 participants. We found that the need for the\
    \ protection mechanism varies with the context of use. Users consider location\
    \ and relationship with the observer when hiding content from unconsented observations.\
    \ Based on the findings, we propose a typology of perceived sensitive content\
    \ considering social aspects in shoulder surfing scenarios. Our typology can be\
    \ used as a baseline for designing personalized shoulder surfing protection mechanisms."

  description: Extended-Reality (XR) devices are packed with sensors that allow tracking
    of users (eg, behaviour, actions, eye-gaze) and their surroundings (eg, people,
    places, objects). As a consequence, XR devices pose significant risks to privacy,
    security, and our ability to understand and influence the behaviour of users-risks
    that will be amplified by ever-increasing adoption. This necessitates addressing
    these concerns before XR becomes ubiquitous. We conducted three focus groups with
    thirteen XR experts from industry and academia interested in XR, security, and
    privacy, to investigate current and emerging issues relating to security, privacy,
    and influencing behaviour. We identified issues such as virtual threats leading
    to physical harm, missing opting-out methods, and amplifying bias through perceptual
    filters. From the results we establish a collection of prescient challenges relating
    to security, privacy and behavioural manipulation within XR and present recommendations
    working towards developing future XR devices that better support security and
    privacy by default.

  description: "Thermal attacks refer to the possibility of capturing heat traces\

    \ such as passwords. The technical feasibility and effectiveness of thermal attacks\
    \ have already been demonstrated. Yet, several preconditions have to be met for\
    \ successful thermal attacks. In this paper, we investigate user awareness of\
    \ thermal attacks and to which extent the attack\u2019s preconditions are met\
    \ in the users\u2019 daily lives. We present results from an online study with\
    \ 101 participants showing that users are frequently at risk of thermal attacks\
    \ based on their behavior, e.g., due to leaving devices unattended, or their choice\
    \ of authentication method. Further, only 7 of our 101 participants had heard\
    \ of thermal attacks. Based on our results, we discuss the implications on user\
    \ security, operators of public spaces, and the development of thermal attack-resistant\
    \ input methods."

  description: "Thermal cameras can reveal heat traces on user interfaces, such as\
    \ keyboards. This can be exploited maliciously to infer sensitive input, such\
    \ as passwords. While previous work considered thermal attacks that rely on visual\
    \ inspection of simple image processing techniques, we show that attackers can\
    \ perform more effective AI-driven attacks. We demonstrate this by presenting\
    \ the development of ThermoSecure, and its evaluation in two user studies (N=21,\
    \ N=16) which reveal novel insights about thermal attacks. We detail the implementation\
    \ of ThermoSecure and make a dataset of 1,500 thermal images of keyboards with\
    \ heat traces resulting from input publicly available. Our first study shows that\
    \ ThermoSecure successfully attacks 6-symbol, 8-symbol, 12-symbol, and 16-symbol\
    \ passwords with an average accuracy of 92%, 80%, 71%, and 55% respectively, and\
    \ even higher accuracy when thermal images are\_\u2026"

  description: "Randomizing the layout of the keypad has been proposed to improve\
    \ the security of PIN entry. However, there has been no empirical quantification\
    \ of its impact on usability and security. We present the first usability (N=\
    \ 17) and security (N= 24) evaluations to compare PIN entry with the standard\
    \ vs randomized layout. Our results show that randomizing the layout increases\
    \ resistance to shoulder surfing and thermal attacks significantly, and has a\
    \ very minor impact on entry accuracy, but it increases entry time (from\u2248\
    \ 1.4 seconds to\u2248 2 seconds). We discuss how this simple approach can improve\
    \ security with little impact on usability."
