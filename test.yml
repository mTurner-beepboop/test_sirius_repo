  description: "\u201CVirtual-Physical Perceptual Manipulations\u201D(VPPMs) such\
    \ as redirected walking and haptics expand the user\u2019s capacity to interact\
    \ with Virtual Reality (VR) beyond what would ordinarily physically be possible.\
    \ VPPMs leverage knowledge of the limits of human perception to effect changes\
    \ in the user\u2019s physical movements, becoming able to (perceptibly and imperceptibly)\
    \ nudge their physical actions to enhance interactivity in VR. We explore the\
    \ risks posed by the malicious use of VPPMs. First, we define, conceptualize and\
    \ demonstrate the existence of VPPMs. Next, using speculative design workshops,\
    \ we explore and characterize the threats/risks posed, proposing mitigations and\
    \ preventative recommendations against the malicious use of VPPMs. Finally, we\
    \ implement two sample applications to demonstrate how existing VPPMs could be\
    \ trivially subverted to create the potential for physical harm. This paper\_\u2026"
