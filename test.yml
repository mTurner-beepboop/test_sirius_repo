  description: "A large body of work investigated touch, mid-air, and gaze-based user\
    \ authentication. However, little is known about authentication using other human\
    \ body parts. In this paper, we investigate the idea of foot-based user authentication\
    \ for public displays (eg, ticket machines). We conducted a user study (N= 13)\
    \ on a virtual prototype, FeetAuth, on which participants use their dominant foot\
    \ to rotate through PIN elements (0\u20139) that are augmented along a circular\
    \ layout using augmented reality (AR) technology. We investigate FeetAuth in combination\
    \ with three different layouts: Floor-based, Spatial, and Egocentric, finding\
    \ that Floor-based FeetAuth resulted in the highest usability with 4-digit PIN\
    \ entry as fast as M= 6.71 (SD= 0.67). Participants perceived foot-based authentication\
    \ as socially acceptable and highlighted its accessibility. Our investigation\
    \ of foot-based authentication paves the way for further studies on the\_\u2026"
